# Installation
Knights and Gobelins is a Tabletop game that I've developed for my French Baccalaureate (High School Diploma).
K&G will need you to install pygame _https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted_ by using pip _https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/_

### If you are using a UNIX system you can follow the instructions bellow to install pip and pygame :

- `cd ~/Desktop/ `
- `sudo apt install pip -y` or `sudo yum install pip -y` depending on your package manager
- `sudo python -m pip install -U pygame`

#### _You can check your python version by using python --version_
#### _You can run K&G by using Python Launcher or by using the command line :_ 
_`python ./<The_Path_Of_Knights_and_Gobelins.py>`_

# Features
### Play from 2 to 4 players !
### Randomly generated map for every new game ! 
### 4 Mini-games : Be brave and face all the challenges to triumph those Mini-games !
### Solo fights against monsters : When the green cursor align with the grey one press Space Key to attack the enemy ! Care, Horde of monsters will need several attacks to be defeated.

# Mini-Games !
### The game features 2 Multiplayer mini-games and 2 Solo challenges (For now !)
- Western Panic ! _(2 Players)_ : 2 player stand against each other, the fastest cowboy win ! 
- Thief's party ! _(2-4 Players)_ : 2-4 players plays as thiefs who try to reach the top of te building to evacuate !
####
- Archer's Duty ! _(Solo)_ : The player need to click on every target that pass on the screen, if one target don't get hit and goes out of screen the player loses.
- Training for the league ! _(Solo)_ : Click on the button as much as you can to try to win !

# Mind that ... !
### The game is still in progress, those are the features that I want to implent in a near future :
- Add the Backpack and Merchants feature.
- Add alternatives map styles with new biomes and new dispositions.
- Add Options tab on the menu and improve global performance of the game to have a static Framerate (or something close to static).
- Add a Piano Solo Mini-game where a melody is played by the computer and the player will need to play it again !
- Add Boss related events such as a portal that leads to the final boss "Steele".
- Add several Multiplayer Mini-games specificly for 3 and 4 players.
- Since the game is only avaible in french for now, and so is all the script, I'll try to update it later to make it more "Worldwide".

### v0.2 Fix :
- Fix a bug that made key press not recognized on Mac OSX
- Improved performance on menu and animation
- Silenced all the print 
- Add Global Tick_rate var
- Add useless wait to know what if statement are empty
